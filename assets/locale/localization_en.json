YOU HAVE CHOICES as a WORLD WIDE customer, you have the opportunity to make choices. As you consider this, we encourage you to make choices that enable us to provide you with quality products and services that help you meet your business needs and objectives.\n\nSecurity of Personal Information \nThe security of personal information about you is our priority. We protect this information by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that meet applicable law. We train our employees in the proper handling of personal information. When we use other companies to provide services for us, we require them to protect the confidentiality of personal information they receive. We endeavour to keep you informed of the latest marketing and promotional offers we feel would be useful and beneficial to you. \n\nPlease refer to our Notice and Choice Principle Statement which outlines how we intend to deliver all the rights and protections you are entitled to in respect of your personal data. In addition, please read World Wide Holdings's Internet Privacy Policy which further outlines our privacy policy for our Internet site users. \nThis section explains our policy regarding any personal information you might supply to us when you visit this site. Our goal is to protect your information on the Internet in the same way that we protect it in all the other ways we interact with you. \n\nThere are instances where certain types of information may be requested from our customers via WORLD WIDE's apps. In addition, strict safeguards have been put in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of any information provided to us. This includes limiting employee access to information and handling information of customers who have ended their membership relationship with WORLD WIDE. \n\nIn the event of any queries or complaints pertaining to the handling of personal information, you can call us or write to WORLD WIDE Holdings (M) Sdn Bhd, or email us. In order to provide better service or to address security hazards, we will occasionally use a \"cookie\". A cookie is a small piece of information which a Web site stores on your Web browser on your PC and can later retrieve. The cookie cannot be read by a Web site other than the one that set the cookie. We use cookies for a number of administrative purposes; for example, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information. Most cookies last only through a single session, or visit to our site. None will contain information that will enable anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or any other means. You can set up your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set. Your browser software may contain a feature which is intended to notify you of the cookie policies of the various web sites you visit. For example, the Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 browser software contained in Microsoft Windows XP contains a version of such a cookie-filtering device, commonly known as P3P. To learn more about P3P and how it may affect your online experience go to www.w3.org/P3P. WORLD WIDE has attempted to make it's apps/website compatible with the P3P privacy filtering tool. However, P3P is still an evolving standard and therefore, we are not responsible for any problems you may experience when using a P3P filter, or any discrepancies between the machine-coded statements of our privacy policy which are read by the P3P tool and the human readable policy which you see here and in the Privacy for Consumers. This Online Data Policy and the Privacy for Consumers at WORLD WIDE are the controlling documents to which you should refer if you have questions about WORLD WIDE's privacy policies. The human readable privacy policy is the only binding legal statement and prevails over any discrepancies from the machine readable privacy policy. \n\nTerms of Use\nWelcome to the World Wide Holdings (M) Sdn Bhd mobile app (the \"Platform\").
